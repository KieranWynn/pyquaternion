            "text": "Welcome\n\n\nWelcome! pyquaternion is a full-featured Python module for representing and using quaternions.\n\n\nThe following should get you up and running with pyquaternion in no time.\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nThe following aims to familiarize you with the basic functionality of quaternions in pyquaternion. It provides an entry point and a quick orientation (no pun intended) for those who want get stuck straight in. More comprehensive feature summaries can be found in the \nfeatures\n and \noperations\n documentation.\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about quaternions and how they apply to certain problems, you can read about quaternions \nhere\n, and their application to rotations \nhere\n.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTo start, you will need to install \npyquaternion\n into your environment.\n\n\n\n\n[Optional] If you are using virtual environments, switch to or create your environment of choice now:\n\n\n$ workon <my_environment>\n\n\n\n\nNow use pip to install \npyquaternion\n and its dependencies\n\n\n$ pip install pyquaternion\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: pyquaternion requires \nNumpy\n for the representation of arrays and matrices.\nChances are if you're needing quaternions, you've been dealing with numerical computation and you're already familiar with numpy.\nIf not, don't worry, it will be installed into your environment automatically.\n\n\n\n\nGreat, you now have pyquaternion installed and you're ready to roll. Or pitch. Or yaw. No judging here :)\n\n\nBasic Usage\n\n\nIn your code, simply import the \nQuaternion\n object from the \npyquaternion\n module:\n\n\n>>> from pyquaternion import Quaternion\n\n\n\nNext, create a Quaternion object to describe your desired rotation:\n\n\n>>> my_quaternion = Quaternion(axis=[1, 0, 0], angle=3.14159265)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: There are many ways to create a Quaternion object. See the \ninitialisation\n section for a complete guide.\n\n\n\n\nNow you can do a bunch of useful things with your new quaternion object. Let's try rotating a vector:\n\n\n>>> import numpy\n>>> numpy.set_printoptions(suppress=True) # Suppress insignificant values for clarity\n>>> v = numpy.array([0., 0., 1.]) # Unit vector in the +z direction\n>>> v_prime = my_quaternion.rotate(q)\n>>> v_prime\n    array([ 0., 0., -1.])\n>>>\n\n\n\nA cool feature of quaternions is that they can be intuitively chained together to form a composite rotation from a sequence of discrete rotations:\n\n\n>>> q1 = Quaternion(axis=[1, 0, 0], angle=3.14159265) # Rotate 180 about X\n>>> q2 = Quaternion(axis=[0, 1, 0], angle=3.14159265 / 2) # Rotate 90 about Y\n>>> q3 = q1 * q2 # Composite rotation of q1 then q2 expressed as standard multiplication\n>>> v_prime = q3.rotate(v)\n>>> v_prime\n    array([ 1., 0., 0.])\n>>>\n\n\n\nQuaternions are used extensively in animation to describe smooth transitions between known orientations. This is known as interpolation. This is an example of an area where quaternions are preferred to rotation matrices as smooth interpolation is not possible with the latter. Here's quaternion interpolation in action:\n\n\n>>> import numpy\n>>> numpy.set_printoptions(suppress=True) # Suppress insignificant values for clarity\n>>> v = numpy.array([0., 0., 1.]) # Unit vector in the +z direction\n>>> q0 = Quaternion(axis=[1, 1, 1], angle=0.0) # Rotate 0 about x=y=z\n>>> q1 = Quaternion(axis=[1, 1, 1], angle=2 * 3.14159265 / 3) # Rotate 120 about x=y=z\n>>> for q in Quaternion.intermediates(q0, q1, 8, include_endpoints=True):\n...     v_prime = q.rotate(v)\n...     print(v_prime)\n...\n[ 0.  0.  1.]\n[ 0.14213118 -0.12416109  0.98202991]\n[ 0.29457011 -0.22365854  0.92908843]\n[ 0.44909878 -0.29312841  0.84402963]\n[ 0.59738651 -0.32882557  0.73143906]\n[ 0.73143906 -0.32882557  0.59738651]\n[ 0.84402963 -0.29312841  0.44909879]\n[ 0.92908843 -0.22365854  0.29457012]\n[ 0.98202991 -0.12416109  0.14213118]\n[ 1. 0.  0.]\n\n\n\nIn the code above, the expression \nQuaternion.intermediates(q0, q1, 8, include_endpoints=True)\n returns an iterator over a sequence of Quaternion objects describing a set of 10 (8 + 2) rotations between \nq0\n and \nq1\n. The printed output is then the path of the point originally at [0, 0, 1] as it is rotated through 120 degrees about x=y=z to end up at [1, 0, 0].\nThis could easily be plugged into a visualisation framework to show smooth animated rotation sequences. Read the full documentation on interpolation features \nhere\n.\n\n\nFor a full demonstration of 3D interpolation and animation, run the \ndemo.py\n script included in the pyquaternion package. This will require some elements of the full \nSciPy\n package that are not required for pyquaternion itself.\n\n\nObject Initialisation\n\n\nA Quaternion object can be created in the following ways:\n\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nQuaternion()\n\n\n\n\nCreates a unit quaternion \n1 + 0i + 0j + 0k\n: the quaternion representation of the real number 1.0, \nand the representation of a null rotation.\n\n\nq1 = Quaternion()\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of rotation, this is a null quaternion (has no effect on the rotated vector).\nFor the purposes of quaternion multiplication, this is a unit quaternion (has no effect when multiplying)\n\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\nQuaternion(other)\n\n\n\n\nClone another quaternion object\n\n\nParams:\n\n\n\n\nother\n must be another Quaternion instance.\n\n\n\n\nq2 = Quaternion(q1)\n\n\n\n\nRaises:\n \nTypeError\n if the provided object is not an instance of Quaternion, or any valid positional argument as outlined below.\n\n\nRandom\n\n\n\n\nQuaternion.random()\n\n\n\n\nCreate a random quaternion that describes a rotation randomly chosen from a uniform distribution across the rotation space. \nSource\n.\n\n\nThis is a class method and is called as a method of the class itself rather than on a particular instance.\n\n\nq3 = Quaternion.random() #

This has the effect that different values could represent the same rotation, for example quaternion q and -q represent the same rotation.

Smaller intervals are more accurate when \nrate\n changes over time.\n\n\n\n\nNote 1:\n This feature only makes sense when referring to a unit quaternion. Calling this method will implicitly normalise the Quaternion object to a unit quaternion if it is not already one. Many quaternion integration algorithms will have unwanted scaling effects leading a quaternion object to become non-unit over time, thus the object is re-normalised with each call to \nintegrate()\n. Because this method is often called very frequently (every \ntimestep\n for realtime simulation) an optimised re-normalisation is performed. See \n_fast_normalise()\n for more info.\n\n\nNote 2:\n The solution is in closed form given the assumption that \nrate\n is constant over the interval of length \ntimestep\n. This algorithm is not an exact solution to the differential equation over any interval where the angular rates are not constant. It is a second order approximation, meaning the integral error contains terms proportional to \ntimestep ** 3\n and higher powers.\n\n\n>>> q = Quaternion() # null rotation\n>>> q.integrate([2*pi, 0, 0], 0.25) # Rotate about x at 1 rotation per second\n>>> q == Quaternion(axis=[1, 0, 0], angle=(pi/2))\nTrue\n>>>\n\n\n\nRaises:\n\n\n\n\nTypeError\n  if any of \nrate\n contents cannot be converted to a real number.\n\n\nValueError\n if \nrate\n contains less/more than 3 elements\n\n\n\n\nAccessing matrix form\n\n\n\n\nrotation_matrix\n & \ntransformation_matrix\n\n\n\n\nGet the 3x3 rotation or 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix equivalent of the quaternion rotation.\n\n\nReturns:\n\n\n\n\nQuaternion.rotation_matrix\n : a 3x3 orthogonal rotation matrix as a 3x3 Numpy array\n\n\nQuaternion.transformation_matrix\n : a 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix as a 4x4 Numpy array\n\n\n\n\nNote 1:\n This feature only makes sense when referring to a unit quaternion. Calling this method will implicitly normalise the Quaternion object to a unit quaternion if it is not already one.\n\n\nNote 2:\n Both matrices and quaternions avoid the singularities and discontinuities involved with rotation in 3 dimensions by adding extra dimensions. This has the effect that different values could represent the same rotation, for example quaternion q and -q represent the same rotation. It is therefore possible that, when converting a rotation sequence, the output may jump between different but equivalent forms.

See the  initialisation  section for a complete guide.   Now you can do a bunch of useful things with your new quaternion object.

The bitwise not operator  ~  can be used to invert the boolean value, however the keyword  not  (logical) is preferred.  Note:  This does not evaluate the booleanity of a quaternion rotation. A non-zero Quaternion object such as  Quaternion(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)  will have a boolean value of  True  even though it represents a  null  rotation.  >>> Quaternion() == True\nTrue\n>>> not Quaternion() == False\nTrue\n>>> Quaternion(scalar=0.0) == False\nTrue",

The inequality operator  !=  can also be used to verify inequality in a similar way.  Because comparisons are carried out on floating point elements, equality is considered  True  when the absolute difference between elements falls below a threshold error. This is determined by  numpy.allclose()  with an absolute tolerance of  1.0e-14  and a relative tolerance of  1.0e-13 . As a result, objects differing by very small individual element differences may be considered equal.  Note:  This does not directly evaluate the equality of a quaternion rotation. For example, unit Quaternions q and -q will have an equality of  False  even though they represent the equivalent rotation.  >>> Quaternion(1, 0, 1, 1) == Quaternion(scalar=1.0, vector=[0.0, 1.0, 1.0])\nTrue\n>>> Quaternion(1, 0, 1, 1) == Quaternion(scalar=1.0, vector=[0.1, 1.0, 1.0])\nFalse\n>>> Quaternion() != Quaternion(scalar=2)\nTrue",
